# Anti-Villager-Lag
A fork of Anti-Villager-Lag adds support for 1.17-1.19

# For this plugin
I will only keep this plugin compatible with the latest Minecraft version  
For villager optimization in version 1.16+, I strongly recommend that you use [Purpur](https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur) instead of this plugin
